Solution #22 The file sum-me.txt has a list of numbers,one per line. Print the sum of these numbers.

Ans: awk ‘{s+=$1} END {print s}’ sum-me.txt



Solution #23 Print all files in the current directory recursively without the leading directory path.

Ans: find . -type f -printf "%f\n"



Solution #24 Rename all files removing the extension from them in the current directory recursively.

Ans: awk ‘!c[$0]++’ faces.txt
