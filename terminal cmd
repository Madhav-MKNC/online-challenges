Ans: find . -name ‘*.doc’ -delete



Solution #20 There are files in this challenge with different file extensions. Remove all files without the .txt and .exe extensions recursively in the current working directory.

Ans: find . -type f -not \( -name ‘*.txt’ -or -name ‘*.exe’ \) -delete



Solution #21 This challenge has text files (with a .txt extension) that contain the phrase “challenges are difficult”. Delete this phrase recursively from all text files.Note that some files are in subdirectories so you will need to search for them.

Ans: find . -name “*.txt” -exec sed -i ‘s/challenges are difficult//g’ {} +



Solution #22 The file sum-me.txt has a list of numbers,one per line. Print the sum of these numbers.

Ans: awk ‘{s+=$1} END {print s}’ sum-me.txt



Solution #23 Print all files in the current directory recursively without the leading directory path.

Ans: find . -type f -printf "%f\n"



Solution #24 Rename all files removing the extension from them in the current directory recursively.

Ans:find `pwd` -type f -exec bash -c 'mv "$1" "${1%.*}"' - '{}' \;



Solution #25 The files in this challenge contain spaces.List all of the files (filenames only) in the current directory but replace all spaces with a ‘.’ character.

Ans:find . -type f -printf "%f\n" | xargs -0 -I {} echo {} | tr ' ' '.'



Solution #26 here are a mix of files in this directory that start with letters and numbers. Print the filenames (just the filenames) of all files that start with a number recursively in the current directory.

Ans: find . -type f -name ‘[0–9]*’ -printf ‘%f\n’



Solution #27 Print the 25th line of the file faces.txt

Ans: sed ‘25q;d’ faces.txt



Solution #28 Print the file faces.txt, but only print the first instance of each duplicate line, even if the duplicates don’t appear next to each other.Note that order matters so don’t sort the lines before removing duplicates.

Ans: awk ‘!c[$0]++’ faces.txt



Solution #29 The file however has been corrupted, there are random ‘!’ marks inserted throughout. Print the original text.

Ans: < war_and_peace.txt tr -s ‘!’ | sed ‘s/!\([a-z]\)/\1/g’ | sed ‘s/!\( [a-z]\)/\1/g’ | sed ‘s/!\.!/./g’ | sed ‘s/ !/ /g’



Solution #30 access.log.1 and access.log.2 are http server logs. Print the IP addresses common to both files, one per line.

Ans: comm -12 <(cut -d’ ‘ -f1 access.log.1 | sort) <(cut -d’ ‘ -f1 access.log.2 | sort)
